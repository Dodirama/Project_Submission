Activity
    Activity the subject was performing during data collection. 
        LAYING            
        SITTING           
        STANDING           
        WALKING           
        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        
Subject 
    The unique identifier given to each person involved in the experiment. 
        Integer [1,30]

The original data set contained many readings for each subject performing each
activity. These readings have been averaged for each subject performing each activity and are all positive numeric values. The prefix "t" denotes time based
signals, and "f" denotes frequency domain signals.

Units of acceleration are metres/second. Units of jerk are metres/second/second.
